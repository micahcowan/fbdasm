#

Saving a program to cassette:
  a clear (zero) bit is sent as a single, short (hi-freq) cycle
  a set (one) bit is sent as a single, longer (lo-freq) cycle

  everything that is sent out to cassette, is sent as:
    20,000 zeroes as padding/sync
    N set bits
    N clear bits (N varies, depending on type of data sent)
    A single set bit
    .
    The payload. Each byte consists of a single start bit, always set,
     and then an octet, MSB first.
    .
    A two-byte checksum, representing a count of how many set bits were
    in the payload. This is sent big-endian (most-significant byte first)!
    .
    A final, single set bit

  When a program is saved, two payloads are sent: program header
  (including name, size) and tokenized program text

  The program header consists of 128 bytes. The first byte (byte 0) is
  always #$02. The next 17 bytes are the program name (up to 16 chars,
  plus a null terminator). Bytes 18 and 19 contain the size of the
  tokenized program text, and bytes 20 and 21 indicate where in memory
  the start of the program was (idk if LOAD respects this). The
  remaining bytes are random garbage.
