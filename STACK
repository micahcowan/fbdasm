  The scroll adjustment that happens in INPUT at @adjForScrlLp - is that a bug?
    Doesn't seem right to me.
  Separate DETAILS.md into separate documents, and stick 'em all in a
    docs/ directory, along with BUGS.md.
  Document keyboard mapping, and how fn keys work with ReadChar
  Document more details about animations, vis-a-vis sprite sheets, etc?
