# STACK: This document is a "note to self" that I use
# to keep track of what code I'm currently analyzing, and how I got
# there, so I can work my way back up to find the next bit of code
# to work on for some larger, overall routine.

# Unlike a 6502 CPU stack, all addresses given are the actual address

BRANCH STACK:

  Walk the code from _Reset, ensuring that we didn't get any bleedover from
  local vars, avoiding magic numbers where practical, and adding any vital
  comments if necessary

  done:


  BUG: (v3 only, probably?) BGTOOL changes the palette for a portion of the bottom of the screen when you type RETURN in SELECT mode. BUT, the tiles for which the palette changes will be WRONG if vScroll1 isn't 0 (and it doesn't set it to 0). You can reproduce this by typing "SCREEN 1" and running some BASIC that scrolls the screen a few lines (or do so via typing). Use "CLS 1" before BGTOOL to prevent the bug.
  Thought not to happen with v2, bc BGTOOL isn't invoked directly from BASIC, and some initialization probably happens before the menu screen that lets you start BASIC and BGTOOL.

  The scroll adjustment that happens in INPUT at @adjForScrlLp - is that a bug?
    Doesn't seem right to me.
  Separate DETAILS.md into separate documents, and stick 'em all in a
    docs/ directory, along with BUGS.md.
  Document keyboard mapping, and how fn keys work with ReadChar
  Document more details about animations, vis-a-vis sprite sheets, etc?
