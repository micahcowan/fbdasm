# STACK: This document is a "note to self" that I use
# to keep track of what code I'm currently analyzing, and how I got
# there, so I can work my way back up to find the next bit of code
# to work on for some larger, overall routine.

# Unlike a 6502 CPU stack, all addresses given are the actual address
# (and not one less).
